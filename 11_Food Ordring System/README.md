Description: Introducing our new app designed for the modern era of online food ordering. Our app has
been developed using two powerful tools - Tkinter and MySQL Connector - to create a
seamless and efficient experience for both customers and restaurant owners.
 For restaurant owners, our app provides a simple and effective way to upload and manage their
menus, receive and process orders, and keep track of customer information. Our app is perfect
for businesses of all sizes, from small cafes to large restaurant chains, looking to streamline
their online ordering process and increase their customer base
